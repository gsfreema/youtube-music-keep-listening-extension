# Chrome YouTube Music Keep Listening Extension

A simple chrome extension that automatically clicks the `Yes` button when YouTube Music prompts if you're still listening. It should work on any browser that supports chrome extensions and even in the YouTube Music PWA if you installed it with your chromium based browser. It has been tested with both Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

Instructions on how to install an unpacked extension can be found [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/).
